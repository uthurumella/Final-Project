# Gundata Game (Alpha Version)

**Project Phase**: Alpha  
**Team**: Ravi, Uday, Sudheer  

## Project Overview

Gundata is a dice prediction game where players bet tokens on a number between 1 and 6. After each round, six dice are rolled. If a playerâ€™s chosen number appears the most frequently, they win tokens based on a multiplier.

This **Alpha Version** demonstrates the core game logic using Java CLI (no GUI yet). The game supports:
- Multiple players
- Choose on only one number per round
- Token tracking
- Owner profit calculation
- Winner declaration (handles tie cases)
